			<p align="justify"> <i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hello! the world calls me as Dipika Bogati.I was born in 5/1/2000 at Kathmandu city and right now, I am 19 years old.I have four family members. They are my father, mother, brother and me.Being the youngest member of the family, I am always surrounded with love and care.Although my permanent resident is at Gorkha, right now I live in Kathmandu city with my family members.My hobby from the childhood was to sing, dance and play games such as Badminton, Basketball, Chess followed by many other games.Not only that, I also love to participate in public speaking.I have also collected numbers of medals and certificates from these games, public speaking and from entertainment field. Right now my passion is coding and I also play games to remain fit as usual. As coding has become the part of my professional life also and people say &nbsp;<span style="color:#808080;font-weight:bold">Sleep,Code,Repeat </span> but it is also one of the favourite things that I do in my daily lifestyle.So, I did not realise when it turn to my passion. Apart from this, I am also fond of travelling. It is said that <strong>"Work,Travel,Save,Repeat"</strong>I want to see all the tiny places of the earth. As we travel not to escape from the life but for the life not to escape us. My parents also encourage me to travel as they always told me that <span style="color:#808080;font-weight:bold">The world is a book and those who do not travel read only a page</span>.<br/><br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am always down to the earth kind of person. Talking about my education background, for the first time I carry my bagpack to the school at the age of three. Then, my education continues as like others. From the education field also, I gathered 2 medals from primary school for being the first and second student in the class. Then I cleared my S.L.C. examination from the <span style="color:#808080;font-weight:bold">Siddhartha Vanasthali Institute</span> located at Balaju,Kathmandu. Not to forget that, this school and friends from there was one of the best things that happened in my life. After that I choosed Science subject for my further study in +2 at <span style="color:#808080;font-weight:bold"> Kathmandu Model Higher Secondary School</span>. It was moment of my life when I dedicated my time only in studies. I had to completely quit my hobbies in order not to distract myself from studies. I completed high school with good marks and a lot of memories. As my major subject was Science, it makes me more easier now to study in  Computer Science at <span style="color:#808080;font-weight:bold"> Islington college</span>,Kamal marga. In this college, I am continuing my bachelor studies with again a lot of cool friends and again making memories that I am going to cherish in my entire life. Like others,I was fond of gaming since childhood. It was one of the reason why my interest in the computer field has increased.</br> </br>For more details of my academic background.
